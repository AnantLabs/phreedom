As of 2013-08-01, this project has been merged with the PhreeBooks ERP project. The home page is located at http://www.phreebooks.com and source code can be found on github.com, project: phreebooks.

The phreedom project will be deleted from Google Code later this year.

PLEASE READ:
Google Code has deprecated the Download capability for any new project and will soon discontinue download capability for existing projects. I read this as Google Code no longer wants to be the home for open source development projects. As such PhreeSoft is moving all open source projects to github.com for code collaboration. Downloads can be found at the project website and sourceforge.net
